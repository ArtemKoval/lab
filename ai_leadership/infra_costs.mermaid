  root((Estimating Costs & ROI of Data Infrastructure))
    Total Cost of Ownership
      - Direct costs - hardware, cloud, licenses, salaries
      - Indirect costs - outages, inefficiency, abandoned experiments
      - Lifecycle costs - maintenance, upgrades, decommissioning
      - Human costs - training, churn, vendor management
    Measuring Infrastructure ROI
      - Strategic acceleration - faster deployment, earlier revenue
      - Risk mitigation - compliance, audit readiness, avoided incidents
      - Reliability value - stabilized pipelines, reduced engineering waste
      - Capability unlocks - real-time inference, experimentation, analytics
    Investment Tiering Framework
      - Foundational - storage, compute, access, basic pipelines
      - Enabling - observability, catalogs, orchestrators, feature stores
      - Differentiating - proprietary pipelines, evaluation frameworks, feedback loops
    Cost-Benefit Modeling
      - Bottleneck quantification - delay costs and iteration gains
      - Incident reduction - engineering time recovered
      - Risk avoidance - breach, fairness, regulatory exposure
      - Capability value - personalization lift, partner acceleration
    Forecasting and Optimization
      - Multi-dimensional scale - teams, workflows, maturity
      - Volatility modeling - bursty workloads, scenario planning
      - Right-sizing - idle compute, workload separation
      - Financial observability - cost dashboards, shared responsibility
    Communicating Value to Leadership
      - Business-first framing - outcomes over specifications
      - Trade-off scenarios - invest vs defer implications
      - Risk and resilience narrative - what infrastructure prevents
      - Compounding value positioning - enterprise acceleration
