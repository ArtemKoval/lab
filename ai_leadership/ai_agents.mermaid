    Definition
      LLM outputs control workflow
      Model decides what happens next
      Not predetermined sequences
    Workflows vs Agents
      Workflows
        Predetermined paths
        Code orchestrates
        Predictable execution
      Agents
        Dynamic decision-making
        LLM controls flow
        Multiple possible paths
    Workflow Patterns
      Prompt Chaining
        Sequential LLM calls
        Fixed step sequence
      Routing
        Triage incoming requests
        Direct to specialized LLMs
      Evaluator-Optimizer
        One LLM generates
        Another LLM validates
    Tool Use Reality
      Just prompting plus if-statements
      No magic reach-back
      Code executes LLM requests
    Framework Spectrum
      Heavyweight
        Autogen
        LangGraph
      Lightweight
        CrewAI
        OpenAI Agents SDK
      Native
        Maximum control
        More development work
    Risks
      Unpredictable outputs
        Inconsistent results
        Testing complexity
      Unpredictable costs
        Feedback loops spiral
        Token burn
      Unpredictable paths
        No guaranteed steps
        Compliance challenges
    Mitigations
      Monitoring
        Visibility into agent actions
        Tools like LangSmith
      Guardrails
        Check at decision points
        Budget and permission controls
