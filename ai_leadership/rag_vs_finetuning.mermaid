    RAG
      Inference time technique
      Retrieves relevant context
      Model stays unchanged
      Fast to market
      Easy updates
      Predictable and explainable
      Limited to existing data
    Fine-Tuning
      Training time technique
      Modifies model weights
      Builds generalizable skills
      Requires GPU clusters
      Needs proprietary data
      High risk high reward
      Enables differentiation
    Decision Framework
      RAG for existing databases
      RAG for quick deployment
      Fine-tune for new capabilities
      Fine-tune for speed
      Combine both approaches
