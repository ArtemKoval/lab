  root((ROI Frameworks for AI))
    Why AI ROI Is Different
      Compound benefits over time
      Front-loaded shared infrastructure costs
      Value through absence - risk never realized
      Adoption dependency on human behavior
      Probabilistic and context-sensitive returns
    Cost Model Components
      Direct development - talent and engineering
      Infrastructure - compute, GPUs, storage
      Data preparation - cleaning, labeling, integration
      Governance - audits, compliance, ethics
      Change management - training, workflow redesign
      Ongoing - retraining, monitoring, adaptation
    Benefit Categories
      Cost savings - automation and efficiency
      Revenue uplift - targeting, retention, optimization
      Risk reduction - expected value of avoided harm
      Time saved - productive capacity unlocked
    Two Dimensions of ROI
      Financial ROI - books, budgets, payback
      Strategic ROI - capability, differentiation, resilience
      Combined framing earns investment
    Audience-Specific Communication
      CFO - NPV, capital efficiency, assumptions
      COO - throughput, cycle time, bottlenecks
      CEO - strategic positioning, market direction
      Board - simplicity, risk, competitive parity
    Common Pitfalls
      Overestimating adoption rates
      Ignoring hidden and lifecycle costs
      Misaligning with strategic priorities
      Unclear measurement methods
      ROI in isolation without narrative
