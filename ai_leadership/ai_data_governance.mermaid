    Core Principles
      Accountability
        Data stewards per domain
        No orphaned data sets
      Transparency
        Lineage tracking
        Metadata capture and audit trails
      Compliance

        Ethical alignment with organizational values
      Adaptability
        Modular frameworks

        Policy setting and decision review
      Domain Stewards
        Embedded in business units
        Bridge central policy and local context
      Structural Models
        Centralized - consistency, bottleneck risk
        Federated - speed, fragmentation risk
        Hybrid - centralized policy, federated execution
    Data Lifecycle
      Creation
        Validation, tagging, classification
      Ingestion
        Pipeline requirements, transformation logic
      Transformation
        Lineage preservation, bias prevention
      Use
        Access control, audit logs, purpose alignment
      Archive
        Retention periods, compliance windows
      Deletion
        PII removal, regulatory alignment
    Governance Pitfalls
      Overcentralization
        Innovation slows, shadow systems emerge
      Policy Without Tooling
        Rules exist, enforcement doesn't
      AI-Compliance Disconnect
        Technical performance, regulatory failure
      Control Over Trust
        Eliminates action instead of enabling guardrails
    Embedded Governance
      Automation
        Schema validation, metadata registration
        API access logging, policy as code
      Metadata Layer
        Source, lineage, ownership, access history
        Powers dashboards, audits, real-time alerts
      Risk-Tiered Oversight
        High scrutiny for sensitive use cases
        Lighter touch for early-stage innovation
    Governance Tooling
      Metadata Platforms
        Collibra, Alation, Atlan, DataHub
      Policy Enforcement
        Schema validation, access control, retention rules
      ML Governance Tools
        Feature stores, model registries, drift monitoring
      Access and Audit
        Fine-grained permissions, activity logs
