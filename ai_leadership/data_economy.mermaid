  root((Building a Data Economy))
    Data as Capital Asset
      Not oil - compounds, not consumed
        Real estate and IP analogy
        Appreciates through reuse and context
      From exhaust to equity
        Purposeful capture and governance
        Compounding returns over time
      Strategic rigor
        Same discipline as financial capital
        Map value, flows, and friction
    Internal Data Economy
      Producers and consumers
        Defined rights and responsibilities
        Cross-functional data exchange
      Conditions for health
        Discoverability and documentation
        Governance that inspires trust
        Network effects from circulation
      Internal marketplace
        Metadata catalogs and search tools
        Freshness scores and quality indicators
        APIs, feature stores, self-service sandboxes
    Monetization Paths
      Direct monetization
        Selling or licensing data products
        Requires rarity, quality, governance
        Risk - collection does not equal value
      Indirect monetization
        Internal value through AI and operations
        Cost savings, revenue lift, risk mitigation
        Often higher ROI than external sale
      Common missteps
        Hoarding without documentation
        Selling poorly governed datasets
        Undervaluing downstream impact
    Data Valuation
      Intrinsic dimensions
        Rarity - proprietary, hard to recreate
        Quality - clean, structured, labeled
        Completeness - full coverage vs partial
        Freshness - recency relative to use case
      Impact-based valuation
        Business outcomes enabled
        Model performance improvement
        Operational efficiency gains
      Depreciation and lifecycle
        Ephemeral data loses value quickly
        Revaluation schedules and archival decisions
    Risk Landscape
      Security
        Every consumer is an access point
        Logging, access controls, data minimization
      Consent
        Not static - expires, can be withdrawn
        Track consent metadata, restrict by legal status
      Bias
        Data reused without context poisons models
        Metadata, origin, and sample limitations required
      Trust as currency
        Without risk controls, economies break
        Trust is the asset you cannot afford to lose
    Power Dynamics and Asymmetries
      Access asymmetry
        Data-rich teams restrict access
        Bottlenecks, shadow systems, duplication
      Contextual asymmetry
        Raw data without explanation
        Misuse, flawed models, redundant discovery
      Incentive asymmetry
        Producers unrewarded for reusability
        Consumers benefit without supporting maintenance
    Incentive Design
      Visibility and recognition
        Stewardship in reviews and briefings
        Career progression tied to data contributions
      Economic mechanisms
        Usage credits and chargeback models
        High-demand datasets receive more investment
      Cultural rituals
        Monthly data expos
        Data champions per business unit
        Reuse retrospectives
