    How to Use Seeds

        Run until you find the right face
        Note the winning seed number
      Step 2: Lock it in
        Use seed as your anchor
        This becomes your character base
      Step 3: Vary everything else
        Change outfits
        Change poses
        Change locations
        Core features stay consistent

      Ignoring seed settings
